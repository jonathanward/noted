## What is Noted?

Noted is a music-focused take on Letterboxd, a social networking platform where users can share their own thoughts on movies. Still in its early stages of functionality, Noted allows a user to add, update and delete their music reviews/journal entries. User entries are stored in a database and displayed in the browser.

Future implementation can include authentication and scaling the app to support a variety of users, as well as the ability to comment on and share others' posts.
